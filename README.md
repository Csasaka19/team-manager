# Team Manager

A project- and task-management web app for small-to-medium teams (2–20 people).
Project managers get strategic oversight across every workstream. Team members
get a focused personal queue. Everyone gets clarity on priorities, progress,
and who's doing what.

Built as a fully-functional **MVP frontend** with mock data — no backend
required to demo. Drop in a real API later and the UI doesn't need to change.

> **Status:** MVP. All eight pages from the product spec are implemented.
> Data lives in React Context, persisted settings live in `localStorage`,
> mutations have an artificial 800ms delay so loading states are visible.

## Highlights

- **Two roles, gated routes.** PMs can do everything. Members can only update
  their own tasks. The Dashboard route is PM-only; a Member hitting it is
  redirected with a toast.
- **Drag-and-drop kanban** powered by `@dnd-kit/core`. Cards reflow optimistically;
  PMs can drag anywhere, Members can only drag cards assigned to them.
- **Inline-edit task detail** with autosaving description, DnD-reorderable
  subtasks, @mention dropdown in comments, status/priority/assignee/due-date
  controls, tags, and a combined activity + comment feed.
- **PM dashboard** with summary cards, a "Needs attention" surface (overdue /
  unassigned / stale / open questions), and a 20-item activity feed.
- **Command palette** (`Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `K` or `/`) groups Actions, Tasks, and
  Projects in one debounced search. Pair it with the global shortcut layer —
  `G` then `D`/`B`/`M`/`P`/`T` for navigation, `C` to create a task, `?` to see
  the full reference. See [Keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts).
- **Quick Create** — a compact 5-field modal (title, project, priority,
  assignee, due date) reachable via `C`, the command palette, the board's
  `+ New Task` button, or a mobile-only floating `+` FAB. Smart project
  defaulting, session-remembered last project, **Create** vs **Create & Open**
  submit modes. See [Quick Create](#quick-create).
- **Bulk actions on the board** — Ctrl/Cmd-click cards to multi-select,
  Shift-click to extend a range within a column, then a floating bar lets
  you set priority / assignee / due date / status, or delete, on every
  selected card at once. Discord receives one summary message instead of N.
  See [Bulk actions](#bulk-actions).
- **Discord integration** — relay task events (created / status changed /
  assigned / completed / commented) to a Discord channel via webhook, with
  rich embeds and per-event toggles in Settings. See
  [Discord integration](#discord-integration).
- **In-app notifications** with a bell + badge in the top bar, auto-emitted on
  assignment / comment / @mention / status change, with per-user preferences
  that actually gate emission.
- **Persisted workspace settings** — workspace name, column rename, and column
  reorder all live in `localStorage` and survive a reload.
- **Mobile-first.** Works at 375px viewport without horizontal scroll. 44px
  touch targets in the top bar.
- **Industrial-clean light & dark themes** with a toggle in the top bar.
  All colors flow through CSS variables — no hardcoded palette values in
  components. Defaults follow `prefers-color-scheme`; explicit choice is
  remembered and applied pre-paint so there's no flash on reload.

## Demo accounts

Two seeded accounts ship with the mock data. Pick one on the login page:

| Role | Email | Password | Lands on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project Manager | `pm@team.com` | `demo1234` | `/dashboard` |
| Team Member | `member@team.com` | `demo1234` | `/my-tasks` |

The PM (Alex Morgan) has visibility on every project and the full Settings
panel. The Member (Sam Chen) sees only their own queue and a simplified
Settings panel.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Pick | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Build tool | **Vite 8** | Fast HMR, native ESM, zero webpack config |
| UI framework | **React 19** | Concurrent features, automatic batching |
| Language | **TypeScript 6** (strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) | Catches the bugs that eat afternoons |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4** | Utility-first; design tokens via CSS variables |
| Components | **shadcn/ui** primitives + `lucide-react` icons | You own the source |
| Routing | **React Router v7** | One `<Routes>` tree in `App.tsx` |
| State | **React Context** (Auth + Data) | No Redux/Zustand/Jotai — Context is enough at this size |
| Drag & drop | `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable` | Tree-shakeable, accessible |
| Toasts | `sonner` | Follows the active theme, bottom-right, auto-dismiss |
| Date math | Custom utils in `src/lib/date-utils.ts` | Demo "now" is anchored — see [below](#mock-data--the-demo-now-anchor) |

The bundle is **~520 KB JS / ~148 KB gzipped** at the moment — under the
typical lazy-loading threshold so all routes load eagerly.

---

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Node 20+ (Vite 8 needs it).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/team-manager.git
cd team-manager
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server boots on **http://localhost:5173**. Log in with one of the
[demo accounts](#demo-accounts) and you're off.

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # serve the production build locally
```

---

## Available scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Type-check (`tsc -b`) then produce a production build in `dist/` |
| `npm run lint` | Type-check only (no emit) |
| `npm run eslint` | Run ESLint over the source tree |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the `dist/` build for a final sanity check |

## Pages

| Page | Route | Default for | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Login | `/login` | Unauthenticated | ✅ |
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | PM | ✅ PM-only, summary cards + needs-attention + activity |
| Board | `/board` | All | ✅ kanban with DnD, filters, `?project=` deep links, PM-only `+ New Task` |
| My Tasks | `/my-tasks` | Member | ✅ Due Today / This Week / Upcoming / Completed buckets |
| Task Detail | `/tasks/:taskId` | All | ✅ full edit surface; 404 for invalid IDs |
| Projects | `/projects` | All | ✅ grid, archived tab, PM-only CRUD |
| Team | `/team` | All | ✅ expandable cards with workload + velocity charts; PM invite/remove |
| Settings | `/settings` | All | 🟡 workspace name + column rename + reorder persist; column add/remove not implemented |
| 404 | `*` | All | ✅ |

🟡 = Settings' "add/remove column" controls aren't wired because `Task.status`
is a fixed union (`'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'in_review' | 'done'`). Rename and
reorder are real and persisted.

---

## Architecture notes

**State layering.** Two contexts, no library:

- `AuthProvider` — current user, `login`, `logout`, `updateCurrentUser`. Persists
  the logged-in user ID to `localStorage` under `team-manager.auth.userId`.
- `DataProvider` — every domain collection (`tasks`, `projects`, etc.) plus
  every mutation. Reads `currentUser` from `AuthProvider` to attribute
  actions, so `AuthProvider` must be mounted above `DataProvider`.

**Mutations.** Every mutation in the store is wrapped in `withMutation()`,
which:

1. Increments an in-flight counter (drives the global `mutating` flag).
2. Awaits an artificial 800 ms delay so loading/disabled states are visible.
3. Runs the actual state update.
4. Decrements the counter.

When you swap to a real backend, replace `withMutation` with your `fetch`
call — every caller already handles the Promise.

**Auto-activity & auto-notifications.** Status changes, assignments, priority
changes, and subtask completions push synthetic `Activity` entries. Assignments,
comments, and `@mentions` also push `Notification` entries — gated by the
recipient's saved preferences (see Settings → Notifications).

**Permission gating** is enforced in three places, deliberately:

1. **Route level** — `ProtectedRoute requirePM` redirects Members away from
   `/dashboard`.
2. **UI level** — Members don't see the Dashboard link in the sidebar, the
   `+ New Task` button on the board, the gear icon on project cards, the
   trash icon on the task header, etc.
3. **Action level** — Even if a Member crafted a `canDragTask`-bypass, the
   drag handler still checks before calling `updateTask`.

Defense in depth, but with a real backend you'd want server-side enforcement
to be the source of truth.

**CSS variables, not Tailwind config.** All colors live as CSS variables in
`src/index.css` and are consumed via `text-[var(--text-primary)]` /
`bg-[var(--bg-surface)]`. This makes theming a one-file change and keeps the
component code free of hex values. The only hex literals in components are
the 8-color **data** palette used for project dots, tag pills, and avatar
hashing.

---

## Mock data & the "demo now" anchor

`src/lib/date-utils.ts` defines a fixed `DEMO_NOW = 2026-05-22T18:00:00Z` and
every "now-relative" computation goes through `now()`. This keeps seeded
fixtures alive forever — dashboard buckets, overdue badges, "this week" lists
all behave the same regardless of when you open the app.

The seeded dataset has:

- **2 team members** — Alex (PM) and Sam (Member)
- **3 projects** — Website Redesign (blue), Mobile App (green), API Migration (amber)
- **6 tags** — bug, feature, urgent, documentation, design, backend
- **19 tasks** — 3 overdue, 5 due this week, 6 done this week, 2 unassigned-high, 4 with subtasks
- **25 activities** — across status changes, comments, assignments, etc.
- **~12 notifications per user**

To swap to real wall-clock time, change one line:

```ts
// src/lib/date-utils.ts
export function now(): Date {
  return new Date()   // was: return new Date(DEMO_NOW)
}
```

---

## Responsive design

Mobile-first throughout. Tested layout assumptions:

- **375 px (iPhone SE):** sidebar is a slide-in overlay with backdrop; top-bar
  buttons are 44 px tap targets; modals are `w-full max-w-[XXX]` with `px-4`
  outer padding; the kanban board scrolls horizontally inside an edge-bleed
  container.
- **768 px (iPad portrait):** sidebar collapses to 64 px icon-only; card grids
  go 2-up; board columns still horizontal-scroll if 4 × 280 px exceeds the
  content area.
- **1024 px+ (desktop):** sidebar at full 240 px; Dashboard summary becomes
  4-up; Projects grid becomes 3-up; Team grid becomes 2-up.

**Light & dark themes.** A `Sun` / `Moon` button in the top bar toggles between
them. The icon shown is the theme you'd switch _to_, which is the convention
most users intuit. Implementation notes:

- Initial theme resolves in order: `localStorage` → `prefers-color-scheme` →
  dark fallback. The chosen palette is applied via a synchronous `<script>`
  in `<head>` before React mounts, so there's no flash of the wrong theme
  on reload.
- Only surface/border/text tokens flip between modes — accent blue, priority
  colors (red/amber/blue/gray), status pills, and destructive red stay
  constant so brand meaning doesn't drift between modes.
- `color-scheme: light` / `dark` is set on each root so native form controls
  (date picker, scrollbars) follow the chosen theme.
- The toggle uses `role="switch"` + `aria-checked` and a dynamic `aria-label`
  so screen-reader users hear the destination state on focus.

---

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements have visible focus rings (`focus-visible:ring-2 ring-[var(--accent-focus)]`).
- Color is never the sole information channel — priority and status both have
  text labels and colors.
- `--text-primary` on `--bg-base` exceeds 7:1 contrast; `--text-secondary`
  exceeds 4.5:1.
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through every interactive element; Enter / Space
  to activate; Escape to close modals, dropdowns, and the command palette;
  arrow keys to navigate result lists and `@mention` lists. A full power-user
  shortcut layer is documented in [Keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts).
- ARIA labels on every icon-only button; `aria-expanded` on disclosure
  triggers; `aria-modal` and `role="dialog"` on every modal.

---

## Keyboard shortcuts

Press `?` from anywhere in the app to see this list in a modal. All
shortcuts are disabled while focus is in an `<input>`, `<textarea>`,
`<select>`, or `contenteditable` element, so they never conflict with
typing — the one exception is `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `K`, which always summons
the palette.

A floating `?` button sits in the bottom-right of every page (on
desktop) for users who prefer to discover shortcuts visually.

### Global

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `K` | Open the command palette |
| `/` | Open the command palette (single-key) |
| `?` | Show the keyboard-shortcut reference |
| `C` | Open [Quick Create](#quick-create) (PM only) |
| `G` then `D` | Go to Dashboard (PM only) |
| `G` then `B` | Go to Board |
| `G` then `M` | Go to My Tasks |
| `G` then `P` | Go to Projects |
| `G` then `T` | Go to Team |

The `G`-prefixed navigation accepts the follow-up letter within 1.5 s
of the `G` keypress; after that the sequence resets.

### Board (`/board`)

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `←` `↑` `→` `↓` | Move the selection ring between cards. Up/Down moves within a column, Left/Right jumps to the same row in the next non-empty column. |
| `Enter` | Open the selected task |
| `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` | Set priority to Critical / High / Medium / Low (PM only) |
| `Esc` | Clear the multi-select set (see [Bulk actions](#bulk-actions)) |
| `Ctrl` / `Cmd` + click | Toggle multi-select on a card (PM only) |
| `Shift` + click | Range-select within a column (PM only) |

The selected card auto-scrolls into view, so navigation works on long
columns without needing to scroll first.

### Task detail (`/tasks/:taskId`)

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `A` | Focus the assignee dropdown |
| `P` | Focus the priority dropdown |
| `S` | Focus the status dropdown |
| `D` | Focus the due-date picker |
| `M` | Jump to the comment input |

Focus-only — the dropdown opens with Space / Alt-Down once focused,
which keeps the shortcuts dependable across browsers (programmatic
`select` opening isn't portable).

### Command palette

The palette groups results into three sections, max 5 rows per group:

- **Actions** — Create task, Create project, the five `G`-prefixed
  navigations, Go to Settings, Log out. Each row shows the keyboard
  shortcut next to its label so it's discoverable.
- **Tasks** — fuzzy match against title and description. Each row shows
  the project dot, project name, assignee, and a status pill.
- **Projects** — fuzzy match against name and description. Selecting a
  project navigates to `/board?project=<id>`.

`↑` / `↓` move within the merged result list, `Enter` selects, `Esc`
closes.

---

## Quick Create

The fastest way to add a task — open the modal, name the thing, pick a
project, hit `Enter`. No description, no subtasks, no tags. Those live on
the task detail page; Quick Create is optimized for capture.

Four entry points, all PM-only:

- The `C` keyboard shortcut (disabled while typing in any input).
- The **Create task** action in the command palette (`Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `K`).
- The **+ New Task** button in the board header.
- A floating **+** FAB in the bottom-right corner on viewports below
  768 px, so touch users have a discoverable creation surface without
  reaching for a keyboard.

The form is five fields:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Title | Required, autofocused, 200-char limit. `Enter` submits. |
| Project | Required dropdown. Pre-selected from context — see below. |
| Priority | 4-button radio row (Critical / High / Medium / Low). Default: Medium. |
| Assignee | Avatar chip → click to open the team-member list. Default: unassigned. |
| Due date | Calendar chip → presets Today / Tomorrow / Next week / No date, plus a custom date input. Default: none. |

### Default-project resolution

When the modal opens it tries to pre-select a sensible project, in this
order:

1. Explicit `projectId` from the caller — the board's **+ New Task**
   button passes the active filter.
2. URL context — `?project=<id>` on `/board`, or the parent task's
   project if you triggered Quick Create from a task detail page.
3. The last project you picked in this tab. Reset on full reload —
   nothing's persisted to `localStorage`, which is deliberate (session
   memory only, per the spec).
4. Nothing — the dropdown shows "Select project…" and the submit
   buttons stay disabled until you choose one.

### Submit modes

| Button | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Create** (primary) | Creates the task, closes the modal, shows a toast with an **Open** link to jump to the new task detail. Optimal for batch entry. |
| **Create & Open** (secondary) | Creates the task and navigates straight to `/tasks/:id`. The toast appears without an action since you're already on the task. |
| `Enter` | Same as **Create**. |
| `Esc` / backdrop click | Closes without creating. |

The new card appears immediately in the appropriate board column (and
in the assignee's My Tasks list, if applicable) — no manual refresh,
since the in-memory store updates synchronously after the artificial
800 ms mutation delay.

---

## Bulk actions

The fastest way to triage a board. Pick a handful of cards, then change
priority / assignee / due date / status (or delete) on all of them in
one click. PM-only — bulk selection mirrors the gating on the
`+ New Task` button.

### Selecting

| Gesture | Result |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl` / `Cmd` + click on a card | Toggle that card in or out of the selection set. |
| `Shift` + click on a card | Range select within the **same column** — fills everything between the last-toggled anchor and the clicked card, in column-sort order. Across columns, just toggles the target. |
| Plain click on a card | Navigates to task detail as usual (selection unchanged for the next page). |
| Plain click on the board background | Clears the selection. |
| `Esc` | Clears the selection. |

Selected cards get a thick blue ring plus a checkmark badge in the
top-left corner. Drag-and-drop is **disabled site-wide while any card
is selected** — so a stray pointer-down can't grab a card instead of
toggling. To resume dragging, clear the selection.

### The bulk bar

When two or more cards are selected, a floating toolbar slides up from
the bottom of the screen (200ms ease-out). It's rounded 12 px,
`var(--bg-elevated)`, with a soft shadow, anchored 16 px above the
viewport bottom.

| Button | Picker | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Set Priority** | Critical / High / Medium / Low | Color-coded icons in the menu. |
| **Assign to** | Unassigned + every team member | First row is Unassigned. |
| **Set Due Date** | Today / Tomorrow / Next week / No date + custom date input | Same presets as Quick Create. |
| **Move to** | Every status in `columnOrder` (respects your Settings rename / reorder) | |
| **Delete** | Confirm modal | Cascades activity + notifications, matching single-task delete. |
| **Clear selection** | — | Also wired to `Esc`. |

After every action a toast confirms `Updated N tasks.` (or
`Deleted N tasks.` for delete), and the selection clears so you can move
on to the next batch.

### Discord summary, not spam

If [Discord integration](#discord-integration) is enabled, a bulk action
emits **one** summary embed instead of one per task — gated by the
event toggle that best matches the action:

| Bulk action | Discord toggle | Summary title |
|---|---|---|
| Move to **Done** | `task_completed` | ✅ Bulk update: tasks completed |
| Move to any other status | `task_status_changed` | 🔄 Bulk update: status changed |
| Assign to a person | `task_assigned` | 👤 Bulk update: tasks assigned |
| Priority / due date / delete / unassign | — | _No Discord message_ (matches single-task behavior — no events exist for those). |

The summary lists the count, the new value, and the actor — same shape
as a single-task embed, just count-scaled.

### Where the code lives

- `src/data/store.ts` — `bulkUpdateTasks(ids, patch)` and `bulkDeleteTasks(ids)`.
  Per-task activity + notifications are pushed in a loop; Discord emits
  once via `buildBulkUpdateEmbed`. Side-effects run outside the `setTasks`
  updater so StrictMode's development double-invocation never doubles them.
- `src/components/board/BulkActionBar.tsx` — the toolbar + its menus.
- `src/components/board/TaskCard.tsx` — modifier-aware click handler,
  checkbox badge, `selectionActive` prop that disables drag.
- `src/pages/BoardPage.tsx` — selection state, Shift-range logic, the
  document-level click listener that clears on background tap, and the
  `Esc` keyboard binding.

---

## Discord integration

Settings → **Discord Integration** (PM only) lets you paste a Discord
webhook URL and pick which task events get relayed. The team sees task
updates land in the channel without anyone opening the app.

### Configure

1. In Discord, **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New
   Webhook**, pick the channel, copy the URL.
2. In Team Manager, paste it into the **Webhook URL** field. The input
   masks the URL by default (it contains a secret token) — click the
   eye icon to reveal.
3. Optionally add a **Channel name** label so future-you remembers
   where this posts (Discord ignores it).
4. Toggle the events you want relayed.
5. Click **Test webhook** to fire a sample embed — a green
   `Webhook connected` card should appear in the channel within a
   second or two.
6. **Save** to persist. Settings live in `localStorage` under
   `team-manager.discord-settings`.

### Events and embed shapes

| Event | Color | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| 📋 Task created | Blue | Project · Priority · Assignee |
| 🔄 Status updated | Purple | From · To · By |
| 👤 Task assigned | Amber | Assigned to · Priority · Due |
| ✅ Task completed | Green | Project · Completed by |
| 💬 New comment | Blue | By · Comment (first 200 chars) |
| ⏰ Overdue (daily summary) | — | _Not wired in this MVP — needs a backend scheduler._ |

All embeds include a `timestamp` so Discord renders the relative time
under the card.

### Where the code lives

- **`src/services/discord.ts`** — types (`DiscordSettings`,
  `DiscordEvent`, `DiscordEmbed`), per-event embed builders, and a
  fire-and-forget `sendDiscordWebhook(url, body)` that swallows errors
  and `console.warn`s them. Callers never block on Discord.
- **Store wiring** — `DataProvider` keeps the latest state slices
  (`projects`, `teamMembers`, `discordSettings`, …) in refs so a stable
  `emitDiscord(event, builder)` callback can read them without
  recreating itself. `createTask`, `updateTask`, and `addComment` call
  `emitDiscord` after their primary state mutations, and emits run
  exactly once even under React StrictMode's double-invoking development
  setters.
- **Settings UI** — `src/components/settings/DiscordSection.tsx`.

### Production: proxy through your backend

Discord webhook URLs are essentially API keys. Shipping them to the
browser means anyone with devtools can copy the URL and spam the channel.
For a real deployment:

1. Stand up an endpoint like `POST /api/discord-relay` on your
   backend that reads the webhook from server config (env var, secret
   manager) and forwards the body to Discord.
2. Change one line in `sendDiscordWebhook` — the `fetch(url, …)` call —
   to hit your proxy with the body shape unchanged. The embed builders
   and emit hooks need no other changes.

Browser-direct posts also have practical limits (CORS works in
practice for Discord, but you don't get rate-limit headers back, and
you can't add per-channel HMAC signing). A proxy fixes both.

## Known limitations

These are intentional MVP cutoffs — the spec calls them out as out-of-scope
or the underlying data model would need to change to support them properly:

- **No backend.** All data lives in React state. Reload = back to seeded
  fixtures. The auth user ID, notification preferences, workspace name, and
  board column overrides are the only things that persist (via `localStorage`).
- **`Task.status` is a fixed four-value union**, so adding or removing board
  columns from Settings isn't implemented. Rename and reorder are.
- **Notification preferences gate emission, not display** — preferences
  applied before today's seeded notifications were generated still show those
  notifications in the bell. Future emissions respect the prefs.
- **`@mention` of a removed team member** still renders the raw handle text
  instead of a grayed-out display name.
- **Real password change** isn't implemented — the mock auth model doesn't
  store passwords, just compares against a hardcoded credential table.
- **Project columns aren't customizable per-project** — column config is
  workspace-wide.
- **No real-time collaboration**, no `fetch`-based loading skeletons (because
  there's no network), no file attachments, no Gantt charts. All explicitly
  out of scope per the spec.

## Contributing

This started as a personal portfolio MVP. If you'd like to extend it:

1. **Read `docs/product-spec.md` first.** It's the source of truth for what
   every page should do, including the edge-case bullet lists.
2. **Read `docs/design-brief.md`** before touching any UI. Colors, spacing,
   and component patterns are all enumerated.
3. **Run `npm run build` after every change.** TypeScript strict + zero
   warnings is the bar.
4. **Don't introduce new top-level dependencies** without a one-paragraph
   justification — the stack rules in `docs/react-stack.md` exist for a reason.
